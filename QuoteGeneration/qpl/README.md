## Build the Intel(R) SGX default Quote Provider Library
- To set the environment variables, enter the following command:
```
  $ source ${SGX_PACKAGES_PATH}/sgxsdk/environment
```
- To build the Intel(R) SGX default Quote Provider Library, enter the following command:
```
   $ cd qpl/linux
   $ make
```
The target library named ``libdcap_quoteprov.so`` will be generated.

You will also need to build  Intel(R) SGX default Collateral Network Library because the Quote Provider Library depends on it:
```
   $ cd qcnl/linux
   $ make
```

The target library named ``libsgx_default_qcnl_wrapper.so`` will be generated.
- To clean the files generated by previous `make` command, enter the following command:
```
  $ make clean
```

- To build debug libraries, enter the following command:
```
  $ make DEBUG=1
```
